Project Description
-------------------
The  Computational  Photometry  Analyzer  for  Small  Satellites(COMPASS)  is a 
desktop-based  rendering  engine  written  in  C++  and  OpenGL used to produce 
accurate graphical  representations  of  RSOs (resident space objects)and their 
environments  as  observed  by  ground-based  telescopes.  These renderings are 
generated  and  processed  within  the  program  in  order  to infer additional 
information about the system including  photometry data, RSO attitude, rotation 
frequency, etc. and provide a platform for testing image processing algorithms. 
An intuitive user interface  is  provided  in order to visually correlate these 
renderings to the associated photometry data.
